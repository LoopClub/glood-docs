    ### Section Status Check
    We've launched a simple yet powerful tool that helps you instantly check if your sections are working perfectly.

    #### What You Can Check
    - **Store Accessibility** – Ensure your store is properly connected.  
    - **App Block Placement** – Confirm that sections are correctly installed in your theme.  
    - **Section Rendering** – Verify that sections are displaying as intended.  
    - **Optimal Section Placement** – Check if your sections are positioned for the best conversion results.  
    - **Recommendation Health** – Ensure product recommendations are working properly.  
    - **AI Recommendations** – Confirm whether AI-powered recommendations are enabled.  
    - **Plan Availability** – Check if your current plan supports this section.  
    - **Serve Limit** – Ensure you have available section views.

    ### Bundle Analytics Improvements
    Your Bundle Analytics just got a major speed boost and some great improvements:

    - **Faster Data Fetching** – Now powered by an **elastic query system**, ensuring rapid and efficient data retrieval.
    - **Seamless Navigation** – The interface now follows a structure similar to **Checkout Upsell Analytics**, making it easier to use.
    - **Fixed Date Picker Issue** – Previously, selecting the same start and end date failed to trigger an API call. This has now been resolved.

    ### Section Design Updates
    We've refreshed the section design to match Shopify's familiar Product Details layout:

    - **Familiar Layout** – Feels just like the rest of your Shopify admin
    - **Better Collection Picking** – Now uses correct collection handles
    - **Improved Recommendations** – Fixed the maximum recommendation count
