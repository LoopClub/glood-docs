title: How to Create Frequently Bought Together Section
---

The Frequently Bought Together section helps boost sales by recommending complementary products that are often purchased alongside the one currently being viewed. These smart, data-driven suggestions appear on the product page or during checkout, encouraging customers to add more items to their cart in a single click — increasing average order value and enhancing the overall shopping experience.

## Implementation Steps

#### 1. Open the "Glood Product Recommendations" app in your Glood.AI admin

Here, you can fine-tune how your Frequently Bought Together recommendations behave on your store. Here’s a quick rundown of the editable options:

**→ Basic Info**

- **Section Name:** You can rename your section here if needed.
- **Set Translations:** Customize how the title appears in different languages.

**→ Recommendation Configuration**

This section allows you to customize how product recommendations are generated for your Frequently Bought Together section. You can combine multiple methods to ensure accurate and dynamic suggestions.

**1. Rule-Based Recommendation**

- Click Configure to recommend products based on specific collection types, tags, product types, or vendors.
- Ideal for category- or tag-specific bundling logic.

**2. 1-1 Manual Recommendation**
- Click Configure to manually select product recommendations for individual products.
- Highest priority – these recommendations override others if set.

**3. Advanced Configuration**

→ Includes extra options:

- **Automatic Recommendation:** Enable this to let the system automatically suggest products based on your store's real-time sales data using proprietary algorithms.
- **Enable Random Recommendations:** Use fallback random suggestions when no data is available.
- **Show Sold Out Items as Recommendations:** If enabled, even out-of-stock items may appear in the suggestion list.

**→ Excluded Products and Tags**
- Excluded Products and Tags are used to remove specific products or tags from being recommended only within this particular section.


- For detailed instructions on excluding products and tags, see our [How to Exclude Products and Tags guide](/for-developers/how-to-guides/how-to-exclude-products-and-tags).

- **Note:** Excluded items won't appear in recommendations for this section only. To exclude items globally, configure them in your store settings.

**→ Disabled Products and Tags**
- Disabled Products and Tags are used to prevent the recommendation section from appearing on specific product pages or pages with specific tags.


- For detailed instructions on disabling products and tags, see our [How to Disable Products and Tags guide](/for-developers/how-to-guides/how-to-disable-products-and-tags).

- **Note:** When a product or tag is disabled, the entire recommendation section will not be shown on those product pages. To disable items globally, configure them in your store settings.

**→ Whitelist Products and Tags**
- Whitelist Products and Tags are used to restrict recommendations to only show specific products or products with specific tags within this section.

- **Note:** When using whitelists, only the specified products or products with the specified tags will be eligible to appear as recommendations in this section. This provides precise control over what can be recommended.



**→ Discount Configuration (Optional)**

The Discount Configuration allows you to set up automatic discounts for products purchased together through this section. You can configure discounts in two ways:

**1. Percentage Discount**

**2. Fixed Amount Discount**

  - Enter a div ID, class selector or xPath to specify the location (default: #shopify-section-product-template)

  - Use breakpoint-based configuration for granular control across different screen sizes
  - For direct theme code placement, copy the provided widget code snippet

**→ Advanced Configuration Settings**
