## Overview

Custom events allow you to control when sections become visible on your store. This guide will show you how to set up and use custom events to trigger section rendering.

Custom events provide a way to control section visibility by:
- Initially hiding all sections
- Showing sections only after specific events are triggered
- Managing section rendering based on user interactions or other conditions

## Configuration

### Set Up Init Event Name

In your app-embed settings, locate the "Init Event Name" section:

```json
{
  "initEventName": "initialize_app"
}
```

This setting tells Glood AI which event to listen for before initializing the widgets.

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

1. Set your desired event name in the "Init Event Name" field
2. By default, no sections will be visible on the store
3. Trigger the event to show sections

### Example

Let's say you set the init event name to "initialize_app":

```javascript
// This will trigger the sections to become visible
dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("initialize_app"));
```

### Common Use Cases

1. **Scroll-Based Loading**
   ```javascript
   window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
     if (isScrolledToBottom()) {
       dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("initialize_app"));
     }
   });
   ```

2. **User Interaction Based**
   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('.load-recommendations').addEventListener('click', () => {
     dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("initialize_app"));
   });
   ```

3. **Time-Based Loading**
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => {
     dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("initialize_app"));
   }, 3000); // Show sections after 3 seconds
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Event Naming**
   - Use clear, descriptive event names
   - Follow a consistent naming convention
   - Avoid generic names that might conflict with other events

2. **Performance**
   - Trigger events at appropriate times to optimize page load
   - Consider user experience when deciding when to show sections
   - Avoid triggering events too early or too late

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always check if the event was successfully dispatched
   - Provide fallback behavior if needed
   - Log events for debugging purposes

## Troubleshooting

If sections aren't appearing as expected:

1. Verify that V3 sections are enabled
2. Check that the event name matches exactly in both settings and code
3. Ensure the event is being dispatched correctly
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Verify that the sections are properly configured
