## Overview

Custom events provide a flexible way to control section behavior in your store. This guide demonstrates how to set up and use custom events to manage section rendering based on various scenarios and conditions.

Custom events enable you to:
- Control section visibility based on specific triggers
- Manage section rendering timing
- Implement custom loading behaviors
- Create dynamic user experiences

## Configuration

### Set Up Init Event Name

In your app-embed settings, locate the "Init Event Name" section inside the app-embed and in the input field write your desired event name (e.g., initialize_app).

This setting tells Glood AI which event to listen for before initializing the sections.

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

1. Set your desired event name in the "Init Event Name" field
2. By default, no sections will be visible on the store
3. Trigger the event to show sections

### Example

Here's a simple example of how to trigger the custom event. When this event is dispatched, Glood AI will initialize all sections that are configured to listen for this event:

```javascript
// This will trigger the sections to become visible
dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("initialize_app"));
```

### Common Use Cases

1. **Scroll-Based Loading**
   ```javascript
   window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
     if (isScrolledToBottom()) {
       dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("initialize_app"));
     }
   });
   ```

2. **User Interaction Based**
   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('.load-recommendations').addEventListener('click', () => {
     dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("initialize_app"));
   });
   ```

3. **Time-Based Loading**
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => {
     dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("initialize_app"));
   }, 3000); // Show sections after 3 seconds
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Event Naming**
   - Use clear, descriptive event names
   - Follow a consistent naming convention
   - Avoid generic names that might conflict with other events

2. **Performance**
   - Trigger events at appropriate times to optimize page load
   - Consider user experience when deciding when to show sections
   - Avoid triggering events too early or too late

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always check if the event was successfully dispatched
   - Provide fallback behavior if needed
   - Log events for debugging purposes

## Troubleshooting

If sections aren't appearing as expected:

1. Verify that V3 sections are enabled
2. Check that the event name matches exactly in both settings and code
3. Ensure the event is being dispatched correctly
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Verify that the sections are properly configured
