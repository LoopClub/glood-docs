Post checkout upsells display personalized product recommendations immediately after purchase completion. These recommendations can significantly increase average order value by suggesting products that complement items the customer has just purchased.

## Troubleshooting

### Unable to See the Checkout Upsell?
If your checkout upsell still isn't showing, verify that your post-purchase configuration is set correctly:

- From your Shopify admin, go to **Settings > Checkout**
- Scroll down to the **Post-purchase page** section
- Under Add tracking scripts and other customizations, ensure **Glood Product Recommendations** app is selected/configured to run post-purchase experiences
- If nothing is selected, choose the **Glood Product Recommendations** app to handle Post Checkout Upsell
- Once configured, this will ensure that your upsell campaigns display on the post-checkout screen.
