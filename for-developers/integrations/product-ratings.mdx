# Product Ratings Integration

This guide explains how to integrate Judge.me product ratings and reviews with Glood.AI recommendations.

## Overview

Product ratings integration allows you to display review stars and ratings from Judge.me within your Glood.AI recommendation sections.

## Supported Review Apps

Currently, we support:
- Judge.me

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Enable Product Reviews Integration

First, enable the product reviews integration in your Glood.AI dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** in your Glood.AI admin
2. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab
3. Find **Judge.me** in the Product Reviews section
4. Click **Enable**

### 2. Add Review Tag to Template

Add the `product_ratings` tag to your section template where you want the reviews to appear:

```liquid
<div class="product-card">
  <img src="{{ product.featured_image | optimise_image: client_info, settings }}" alt="{{ product.title }}">
  <h3>{{ product.title }}</h3>
  <div class="price">{{ product.price | money_formatter: glood }}</div>
  
  <!-- Add product ratings here -->
  <div class="reviews">
    {% product_ratings product_id: product.id %}
  </div>
</div>
```

The `product_ratings` tag will automatically:
- Generate the appropriate Judge.me widget markup
- Handle the review data fetching
- Display review stars and rating count

### Example Output

When properly configured, the tag will generate HTML like this:

```html
<div class="jdgm-widget jdgm-preview-badge" data-id="1234567890" data-auto-install="false"></div>
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Reviews not showing**: Verify that Judge.me is properly installed and configured in your store
- **Missing ratings**: Ensure the product has reviews in Judge.me
- **Widget not loading**: Check that Judge.me scripts are properly loaded in your theme

## Best Practices

1. Always test the integration with products that have reviews
2. Consider loading performance when adding reviews to many products
3. Provide fallback content when reviews are not available
4. Test the integration across different devices and screen sizes
