# Activating Glood.AI

After installing Glood.AI from the Shopify App Store, you'll need to activate it on your store using Shopify's Theme Editor. Follow these simple steps:

## Enable the App Embed Block

1. Go to your Shopify admin panel and navigate to **Online Store** > **Themes**

2. Find your current live theme and click **Customize** to open the Theme Editor

3. In the Theme Editor, click on **Theme Settings** at the bottom of the left navigation panel

4. Select **App embeds** from the settings menu

5. Find "Glood.AI Recommendations" in the list and toggle it **ON**

6. Click **Save** in the top-right corner to publish your changes

<Note>
The app embed block must be enabled for Glood.AI recommendations to appear on your store. If you switch themes later, you'll need to enable the app embed block again on the new theme.
</Note>

## Verify Installation

After enabling the app embed:

1. Visit your store's frontend
2. Check that Glood.AI recommendation sections appear where configured
3. Verify that product recommendations are loading correctly

If you don't see recommendations appearing, try:
- Refreshing your browser cache
- Waiting a few minutes for changes to propagate
- Checking that you saved the Theme Editor changes
- Contacting support@glood.ai if issues persist

## Next Steps

Once Glood.AI is activated, you can:
- Create your first personalized recommendations section
- Customize the appearance of recommendation widgets
- Configure advanced settings and targeting rules
- Track performance in the Glood.AI dashboard
